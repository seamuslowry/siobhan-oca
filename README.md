This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project built to host a personal and professional site for Siobhan Oca.

## Configuration

Many aspects of this site are designed to configurable through `.txt` or `.csv` file changes rather than direct code changes for easy updates.

## Home Page

### Metadata

The metadata information of the home page is set by the two text files at
- `public/metadata/home/title.txt`: this is the title of the page and will display on the tab in the browser
- `public/metadata/home/description.txt`: this is a description of the page primarily displayed in site summaries generated by search engines or when messaging clients generate a link preview

### Hero Image

The hero image for the site is stored in `/assets/home/hero.png`. This image should be large and high-quality with a focus on the center horizontal.
For screens smaller than 640px horizontally, the image will not be shown.

### Banner Image

The banner image for the site is stored in `/assets/home/banner.png`. This image should be high-quality and with a 1:1 aspect ratio. It will be cropped to a rounded circle and is intended for a face or logo. It will show on all resolutions of screen.

## Local Development

To run the development server, first install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This will allow you to install multiple node versions and easily switch between them. The installation of this command will vary by OS. Once installed, run the below to start the development server:

To run the development server:

```bash
# install the node version specified in .nvmrc
nvm install
# use that node version
nvm use
# install all dependencies
npm install
# run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
