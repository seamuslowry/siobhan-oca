This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project built to host a personal and professional site for Siobhan Oca.

## Configuration

Many aspects of this site are designed to configurable through `.txt` or `.csv` file changes rather than direct code changes for easy updates.

## Home Page


### Text Content

The text content for this page is stored in `/assets/home/content.yaml`. The fields are:
- `metadata.title`: This is the title of the page and will display on the tab in the browser.
- `metadata.description`: This is a description of the page primarily displayed in site summaries generated by search engines or when messaging clients generate a link preview.
- `hero.alt`: The alt text for the hero image.
- `banner.alt`: The alt text for the banner image.
- `banner.title`: The extra large text just below the image.
- `banner.email`: The email address below the title. The site will attempt to structure this as a `mailto:${email}` link in addition to displaying the text.
- `banner.content`: An array of strings. Each string will be displayed under the banner in a separate paragraph tag. This was tested with 2 tags. An excessively long list may cause the banner content to compress or overflow.

Under the metadata section, any [NextJS metadata fields](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-fields) assignable through YAML syntax may be set in this object.

### Hero Image

The hero image for the site is stored in `/assets/home/hero.png`. This image should be large and high-quality with a focus on the center horizontal.
For screens smaller than 640px horizontally, the image will not be shown.

### Banner Image

The banner image for the site is stored in `/assets/home/banner.png`. This image should be high-quality and with a 1:1 aspect ratio. It will be cropped to a rounded circle and is intended for a face or logo. It will show on all resolutions of screen.

## Local Development

To run the development server, first install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This will allow you to install multiple node versions and easily switch between them. The installation of this command will vary by OS. Once installed, run the below to start the development server:

To run the development server:

```bash
# install the node version specified in .nvmrc
nvm install
# use that node version
nvm use
# install all dependencies
npm install
# run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
